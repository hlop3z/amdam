# Test Fullstack Functions

## Backend & Frontend Development
* Python with     : Cherrypy, Quart & Sanic (for Linux ONLY)
* Javascript with : Vuejs and Vuetify

### Installing

```
python -m pip install https://github.com/hlop3z/amdam/raw/master/dist/amdam-0.0.1.tar.gz
```

### Notes: Linux
In Linux you can run python, sh and sh-scripts in the browser.

### Notes: Windows
In Windows some functions are hidden because they did not work, either way, I strongly recommend using Linux if you are a developer. **< Just kidding, even if you are not a developer use Linux >**
